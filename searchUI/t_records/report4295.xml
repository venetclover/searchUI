<report_text>[Report de-identified (Safe-harbor compliant) by De-ID v.6.22.07.0]


The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old white female admitted to the service of Dr. 
**NAME[VVV] and **NAME[ZZZ] with overall fatigue.  She has multiple medical 
problems, considering diabetes type 2, as well as asthma, post stroke 2001.  
She has also had a knee replacement.  At this time complains of pain to the 
lower right anterior area where I was able to elicit some fluid coming from 
the mobile, periodontally-involved lower right incisor.  

If you want this done while she is in this hospital stay, just clear her to 
have it done under local with intravenous conscious sedation, as well as 
antibiotic coverage post-knee replacement.  If this is okay with you, then 
just contact my office  **PHONE.  We can make the arrangements to have 
it done up in the OR.
