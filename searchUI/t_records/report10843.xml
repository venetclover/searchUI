CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Heme in nasogastric tube.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old gentleman who has a history
of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his foot and necrosis of his
fourth and fifth digits.  He has had severe hypotension, non Q wave myocardial
infarction and type 2 diabetes, dementia, anemia and chronic renal disease.  I
was asked to evaluate him due to a nasogastric tube with coffee ground emesis.
I am unable to get any history from the patient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
of 45%, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery bypass graft x3 in 2000, right carotid

surgery.

MEDICATIONS: Allopurinol, aspirin, Lipitor, Plavix, Digoxin, Lexapro, Lasix,
Glipizide, Imdur, nifedipine, Protonix, OxyContin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  On exam he is a very ill appearing gentleman, thin, well developed in
on acute distress.

NECK: Supple.

LUNGS: Clear.

HEART: Regular rate.

ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, no rebound, guarding or hepatosplenomegaly.

IMPRESSION:

issue for this gentleman.  I am not going to proceed with any further
evaluation.  We will follow him and continue with proton pump inhibitor
