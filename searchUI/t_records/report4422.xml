TIME:  8 p.m.

This is a consult from Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] for an incurvating, left great toe.

HISTORY:  The patient is well known to me.  She has been seen occasionally 
for this problem as a house call as the patient does not do well getting into 
the office.  She was admitted at this visit with cellulitis of the legs and 
also a dental problem.  The patient is alert.  She is semi-ambulatory.  She 
has absence of pedal pulses, and all nails are dystrophic.  She has an 
incurvating nail causing pain and what seems to be a resolving infection from 
the antibiotic therapy.  At this time, she has a limitation of motion at the 
first MPJ and redness in the legs.  The skin of the feet is intact.  The 
gross sensation does seem to be diminished.  She has a long history of 
diabetes.

ASSESSMENT:  We will debride the nails for the patient's comfort and remove 
the incurvating fibular portion of the nail to make sure the onychia is 
resolved.  Upon removal, no pus was found underneath the area because of the 
antibiotic therapy.

PLAN AND TREATMENT:  Removal of bending portion of nail and evaluation of 
onychia, left great toe and debridement of other nails for the patient's 
comfort.  We will, distal on the left great toe, use Betadine b.i.d. for 3 
days as to shrink the tissue of the fibular border, left great toe.
